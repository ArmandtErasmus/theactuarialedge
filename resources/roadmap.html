    <h1>Route to Becoming an Actuary</h1>
    <p>The exact steps you can take to qualify as an actuary, whether you come from a traditional actuarial science degree or a non-traditional degree like physics.</p>

                    <h4>Choose your entry path</h4>
                    <p>Most students enter via accredited actuarial degrees (UCT, UP, NWU, Wits, SU), which grant exemptions for A-series exams.
                    Non-traditional students (math/physics/stats) can enter too, but may need strong marks and a recommendation from their university
                    to join ASSA directly.</p>

                    <div class="step-badge">2</div>
                    <h4>Student membership</h4>
                    <p>Apply to ASSA as a student member. If you studied an accredited degree, apply for exemptions. 
                    You’ll also begin mapping out A1, A2, and the Normative Skills pathway, which includes professionalism and communication training.</p>
                </div>

                    <div class="step-badge">3</div>
                    <h4>Exams + work-based learning</h4>
                    <p>Write the A-series exams (A111–A214), A311, and complete Normative Skills assignments.  
                    Secure an actuarial trainee or analyst role to begin Work-Based Learning (WBL) — mandatory real-world experience signed off by a supervisor.</p>

                    <h4>Fellowship track</h4>
                    <p>Choose one Fellowship Principles subject (F101–F108) and then one Fellowship Applications subject (F201–F207 or B200).
                    These define your practice area (life, general insurance, pensions, health, banking, investments, ERM).</p>

                    <p>Complete your WBL, professionalism courses, ethics modules, and final checks for FASSA. 
                    After qualification, maintain annual CPD and continue developing within your chosen specialty.</p>

                    <h4>Pick your launchpad</h4>
                    <p>You can start with an actuarial degree or almost any strong quantitative degree (math, stats, physics, computer science, engineering, finance).
                    IFoA is very accessible for non-traditional students with a technical background.</p>

                    <p>Register with the IFoA. Apply for university exemptions if your degree is accredited.  
                    Plan your exam progression through Core Principles (CS, CM, CB) — typically the mathematical foundation.</p>

                    <p>Write the Core Principles followed by the Core Practice exams (CP1, CP2, CP3).
                    During this stage, you must also start accumulating PPD (Personal and Professional Development) through work experience.</p>

                    <p>Select two Specialist Principles (SP) subjects and one Specialist Advanced (SA) subject.
                    These define your chosen actuarial pathway, such as Life, GI, Pensions, Health, Risk Management, Investments, or Banking.</p>
